```{r}
delta <- read.csv2(here("data", "database_models.csv" ))
str(delta)
delta.flower <- delta %>% 
  mutate(Site = as.factor(Site)) %>% 
  mutate(Road.verge = as.factor(Road.verge)) %>% 
  rename(trials = Total.no..of.flowers) %>% 
  rename(successes = Number.marked) %>% 
  mutate(Same.side = as.factor(Same.side)) %>% 
  mutate(Direction = as.factor(Direction)) %>% 
  rename(distance = Distance.to.marked..m.) %>% 
  mutate(failures = trials - successes) 
str(delta.flower)
```
The first model tests whether the movements across the road are influenced by the number of flowers in each side of the road (in the road verges). To do this, a new variable (delta.flower) was created. This variable contains two types of information:
1. The direction of the movement. If the movement was from the highest flower abundance side to the lowest, the sign is negative (lowest - highest). If the movement was from the lowest side to the highest, the sign is positive (highest - lowest). Since there are 2 colours (one in each side of the road), sites have complementary data for each colour.
2. The difference in number of flowers between the 2 road verges. The higher the value, the higher the difference. 

Response variable: number of successes (number of marked flowers - total number of flowers per group)
Explanatory variables: 
1. delta flower (see above). Scaled
2. distance from the unmarked group to the marked groups
3. insect abundance in the corresponding side of the road (flower-visiting counts). Super-confusing, ask in meeting if confused. (logged)
